To start using your smartphone as a security key on a computer, first you need to either:  

- pair your smartphone with that computer, or  
- have an IDmelon Reader.  

Then, you can add your security key to your accounts such as Microsoft and Twitter.  

Choose your status:  

{{< btn value=`I want to pair with my PC.` href=`/pages/pairing/step1` >}}

{{< btn value=`I already paired with my PC.` href=`/pages/setupasecuritykey` >}}

{{< btn value=`I have an IDmelon Reader.` href=`/pages/want-reader` >}}

{{< btn value=`What is IDmelon Reader?` href=`/pages/reader/index.html` >}}

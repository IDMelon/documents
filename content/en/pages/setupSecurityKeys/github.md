[Check here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication#configuring-two-factor-authentication-using-fido-u2f).  

1. Sign in to your GitHub account.  

2. In the top-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then choose **Settings**.  

3. In the **Access** section of the sidebar, click **Password and authentication**.  

4. Next to **Security keys**, click **Add**.  

5. Under **Security keys**, click **Register new security key**.  

6. Type a nickname for the security key, then click **Add**.  

    - If you are using an IDmelon Reader, insert it into the USB port of your device, tap your smartphone to the Reader which starts blinking blue for a few seconds to receive the notification.  

    - If you are using IDmelon Pairing Tool, you will receive the notification on the smartphone which is already paired with your computer.

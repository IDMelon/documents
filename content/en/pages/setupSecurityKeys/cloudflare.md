1. In **Security Key Authentication**, click **Add**.  

2. Enter your Cloudflare password on the **Add a Security Key** screen, then click **Next**.  

3. A dialog appears. **Interact with** your security key to add it to your Cloudflare account.  

    - If you are using an IDmelon Reader, insert it into the USB port of your device, tap your smartphone to the Reader which starts blinking blue for a few seconds to receive the notification.  
    
    - If you are using IDmelon Pairing Tool, you will receive the notification on the smartphone which is already paired with your computer.

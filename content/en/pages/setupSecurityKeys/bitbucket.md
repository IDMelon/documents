Bitbucket supports security keys that use the FIDO U2F standard. These keys only work with a recent version of Google Chrome, which means that you need to install or update your browser if you want to begin using a security key.

Before adding a security key to your Bitbucket account, you must first enable Two-step verification.

To add a security key:

1. From your avatar in the bottom left, click **Personal settings**.
2. Click **Two-step verification** under Security.
3. Under **Security keys**, enter a name for your device in the text box.
4. Click **Add security key**:

    - If you are using an IDmelon Reader, insert it into the USB port of your device, tap your smartphone to the Reader which starts blinking blue for a few seconds to receive the notification.
    - If you are using IDmelon Pairing Tool, you will receive the notification on the smartphone which is already paired with your computer.

5. Done!

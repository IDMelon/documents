To add a security key on your desktop, you'll need to be using the latest version of Chrome, Opera, Firefox, Edge, or Safari.  

To add a security key:  

1. Go to your Security and login settings.  

2. Scroll down to Use two-factor authentication and click Edit. You may be asked to re-enter your Facebook password at this point.  

3. Click Use security key.  

4. Click Register security key then follow the on-screen instructions. (If you do not see the Register Security Key option, you may need to update your browser.)  

    - If you are using an IDmelon Reader, insert it into the USB port of your device, tap your smartphone to the Reader which starts blinking blue for a few seconds to receive the notification.  

    - If you are using IDmelon Pairing Tool, you will receive the notification on the smartphone which is already paired with your computer.  
    
5. Once youâ€™ve successfully added a security key to your account, you can start using it when you log in.

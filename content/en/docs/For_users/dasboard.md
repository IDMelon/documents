Every user has 2 parts in their panel. On part is [SSO (Simple sign-on)](#sso-(simple-sign-on)) which enables them to login by using their active accounts and security keys. The other part is the [Dropdown menu](#dropdown-menu) which enables users to access their profile and settings.

If you click on the arrow or your username, a **Dropdown** menu will be opened with 3 options. The first option is **Security**,

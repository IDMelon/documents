Every user has 2 sections in their panel. On section is [SSO (Simple Sign-On)](#sso-(simple-sign-on)) which enables them to login by using their active accounts and security keys. The other section is the [Dropdown menu](#dropdown-menu) which enables users to access their profile and settings.

## SSO (Simple Sign-On)

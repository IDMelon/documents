Every user has 2 sections in their panel. On section is [SSO (Simple sign-on)](#sso-(simple-sign-on)) which enables them to login by using their active accounts and
security keys. The other section is the [Dropdown menu](#dropdown-menu) which enables users to access their profile and settings.

### SSO (Simple Sign-On)

Every user has the **Simple Sign-On** option in their panel. By clicking this option, they can see **My Apps**. Inside **My Apps**, they can see a page the same as below.
This option allows users to access the applications and websites which they can see in their panel by their own security keys.

The first step to log in is to open [this link](#https://panel.idmelon.com/). So
After openning IDmelon panel you will see the image below, which you have multiple ways to login.

- You can login by clicking on "sign in with a security key", for this one to work, you need to have IDmelon mobile app and a Reader or Pairing Tool installed on your computer or you can use a FOB to tap and log in.

When your organization rolls out IDmelon, one of your organization’s admins sends an invitation email to your work email
address to activate your work account. From then on, you will be able to use your smartphone as a FIDO security key.

## Preparation

- First you have to Install IDmelon Mobile App from [App Store](#https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/idmelon/id1511376376) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vancosys.authenticator.business&pli=1).

- After installing the app, open it to see a page shown below.

- Then, choose "Business/School".

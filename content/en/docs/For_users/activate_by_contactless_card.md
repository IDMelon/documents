When using IDmelon Security Key as a Service, Contactless Cards can be used as a security key. The admin of your
organization can activate a card for you or he can send an invitation email which help you register your card.

## Activation by admin

In case of activating the card by admin, you receive an email containing a PIN number and you can use your card right away.

When using IDmelon Security Key as a Service, Contactless Cards can be used as a security key. The admin of your organization can activate a card for you or they can send an invitation email which helps you register your card.

## Activation by admin

---

In case of activating the card by an admin, you receive an email containing a PIN number and you can use your card right away. Or if the admin activates the PIN-less verification method for you, your card will be activated without a PIN.

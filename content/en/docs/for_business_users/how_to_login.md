In order to login, you need to have an active account in [IDmelon Panel](https://panel.idmelon.com).

The first step to log in is to open [this link](https://panel.idmelon.com). So after opening IDmelon panel, you will see the image below, which shows multiple ways to log in.

## Login page

- You can login by clicking on **Sign in with a security key**, for this one to work, you need to have IDmelon mobile app installed on your phone with either a Reader or Pairing Tool installed on your computer or you can also use a FOB to tap and log in.

- If you do not have any of the above tools to log in, you can choose **Sign-in options**, which will be discussed later.

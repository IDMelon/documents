## What is FIDO?

<hr class="hr-line">

FIDO is an open authentication protocol to eliminate passwords and their related security threats. To use FIDO, user first must complete the registration process and
selecting the method of authentication (biometric factor). Then users can log into FIDO supported products or services by only providing a biometric factor which can be a
fingerprint, face ID (look in the camera), or entering a PIN. It depends on the available capabilities of users’ smartphone and methods the product or service can handle.
The process of authentication from user’s point of view is simple and only needs providing the biometric factor, the rest of the process is done behind the scenes without
even noticed. For more information about FIDO, you can visit FIDO alliance [here](https://fidoalliance.org).

## FIDO security

<hr class="hr-line">

<p>
Passwords are hard to remember, need to be changed frequently and also need resources when reset required. The FIDO2 helps stop the password chaos and improve the user
experience. It uses standard public key cryptography to secure user authentication by encrypting all communications. Private keys and biometric information if used to
authenticate never leave users’ devices, which lessens the chances of discovering them during transmission and makes authentication processes stronger and more secure.<br><br>
FIDO2 is built with FIDO Client To Authenticator Protocol (CTAP) and W3C standard WebAuthn which both work together to provide passwordless authentication experiences for
users. These experiences might involve embedded authenticators, like biometrics or PINs or USB devices. WebAuthn defines a standard web API for platforms and browsers to
support FIDO which communicates with CTAP authenticators to provide an interface for creating and managing public key credentials. CTAP allows the authenticator (part of the
user’s computer or smartphone, or an external piece of hardware) to be used as both the first and second factor of authentication to provide users a passwordless
authentication experience.<br><br>
When a user attempts to access an online service for the first time, they are prompted to register. During registration, a new key pair is generated that the private key is
stored on the device and associated with the id and domain of the online service, while the public key is stored in the online service’s key database on a server. Each time
the user attempts to subsequently access the service, the online service uses APIs to verify user credentials with the authenticator.
When the user attempts to sign on to an application, a FIDO2 server, sends the FIDO client (browser, desktop or mobile application) a challenge using WebAuthn, asking it to
sign the data with the private key. The user consents to the request by using a method of authentication. The domain is checked against the domain that was associated at
registration time which gives FIDO its **strong phishing resistance**. The client obtains the private key from the authenticator and answers the request in a way that proves
the device has possession of the private key to gain access to the online service for user. From now on communication is encrypted throughout this process, and private keys
never leave users’ devices.

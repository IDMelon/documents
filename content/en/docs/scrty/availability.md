Availability is an indicator for a consistent level of a service, which is up and running and usable for its users for
prolonged time periods. It can be considered the key indicator of overall service health. Highly available architectures
typically through deploying redundant components aim to maximize service availability. Simply put, achieving high
availability involves distributing compute resources and replicating data and balancing load between them.

Also, scalability is the system's ability to handle varying amounts of work by adding or removing resources. The
flexibility to adjust the capacity to meet demands and resources consumed by the service as a key business driver moved
IDmelon to the Google cloud. Google Cloud helps us maintain a good user experience during periods of high traffic by
adding more resources.

To increase availability and scalability of our services, we located them on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and employed
Google Cloud tools and services. As a result, IDmelon services work under GCP tools, services, and built-in features.
Google Cloud provides multiple features to help build scalable and efficient services which we use as follows:

- **Compute Engine** virtual machines integrate with auto-scalers that grow or shrink resource consumption based on
  defined metrics; to distribute and manage instances across the regions and zones.
- **Cloud Monitoring** provides metrics across services and infrastructure, helping us to make data-driven scaling
  decisions across our services and infrastructure about their performance.
- **Google Cloud Regions and Zones** across multiple continents to best meet our availability goals.
- **Internal and External Load-Balancing** options to manage the service traffic.

## Physical distribution of resources

---

Google Cloud services are available in locations divided into regions and zones across the globe. How an organization
deploys its service across these regions and zones affects the availability and latency of the service. Redundancy is
the duplication of components of a service or system to increase the overall availability. In Google Cloud, redundancy
is achieved by deploying the service in multiple zones or even regions which helps the service to better withstand any
disruptions.

IDmelon using Compute Engine, distributes its service in four zones in four different regions. This way we can manage
the instances as a logical unit.

## Load-balance at each tier

---

Load balancing distributes traffic among groups of resources. Distributing traffic helps to ensure that individual
resources don't become overloaded while others sit idle. Google Cloud offers several load-balancing choices depending on
the type, source, and other aspects of the traffic. It's a common practice to load-balance requests received from
different external sources, such as web or mobile clients. However, using load balancers between different services or
tiers within the service can also increase resilience.

We use an external load balancer to separate traffic of different components (mobile and Pairing Tool). The whole
structure consists of four zones in four regions (North America, Europe, Asia, and Canada) with internal load balancing
to distribute traffic from the web tier to the internal tier within each region. It also has an external load balancer
to divide mobile and Pairing Tool traffic.

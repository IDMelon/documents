## Abstracted System Overview

<hr class="hr-line">

<p>This abstracted system architecture overview outlines the components and services used to build and run IDmelon Passwordless Orchestration Platform (IPOP) on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It explains how the components interact with each other to provide the applicationâ€™s functionalities. It also provides an overview of how the application is deployed and configured on the Cloud.<p>

## System Security

<hr class="hr-line">

<p>
IPOP has a comprehensive security strategy that provides confidentiality, integrity, and availability; all designed by our security experts. <br></br>
On the layer of data security, we address latest security measures. Credentials are stored encrypted or in Google Hardware Security Module (HSM) and keys are securely managed by Google Secret Manager to ensure latest security measures are always applied. <br></br>
Concerning data transfer, we have made sure to implement best practices such as input validations, TLS, Cloudflare protections, data encryption, CORS, sanitization, and many more.

## Sync with Azure AD

<hr class="hr-line">

<p>
To sync groups, users, and devices with Microsoft Azure Active Directory, we safely follow the official Microsoft GraphAPI and documentation. The following diagram depicts an overview of the sync process:

## System Updates

<hr class="hr-line">

<p>IDmelon leverages automation CI/CD and GCP tools to ensure that all components are updated in a coordinated and timely manner. To ensure that the system remains stable during the upgrade process, we will use backup and rollback strategies to ensure that any unexpected issues can be quickly addressed. Additionally, our rolling release strategy ensures that users always receive the latest updates as quickly as possible. Finally, we use monitoring tools to ensure that the system is performing as expected and that any potential problems are quickly identified and addressed.</p>

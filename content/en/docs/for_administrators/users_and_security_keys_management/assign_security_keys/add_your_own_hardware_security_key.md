Steps for adding your own Hardware Security Key as a Security Key:  

1. Log in to the admin panel.  
2. Go to the **Users** section on the left-side menu, click the **All Users**. This section lists all users associated with your workspace.  
3. Initiate User Addition: Click on the **New User** option to open a wizard for adding a new user.  
4. Enter User Information: In the wizard, enter all the necessary information about the user. This might include details like user ID, name, email, username, etc. Choose the groups that you want the user to be a part of. These groups might determine the userâ€™s permissions and access rights and Click the **Done** button.  
5. Security Key Assignment: If you want, you can also assign a security key of any type, i.e. smartphone, card, fingerprint, or USB Key, to this user.  
6. Select the fourth option in the security key device, labeled as **USB Key**.  
7. Set a name for the USB Key in the box that is displayed and click the **Next** button.  
8. Your user will receive an email containing a hardware security key activation link. By clicking on the activation link and selecting your hardware security key, the key will be activated for the user.  
9. Completion: Once the user successfully sets up their hardware security key, it can be used for passwordless logins based on the FIDO2 standard wherever available.  

Ensure that your hardware security key is compatible with the FIDO2 standard and that you follow any manufacturer-specific instructions for setup and usage.

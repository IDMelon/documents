### It is how you can view a list of their recent activities:

(related to registrations of credentials and logins with them and deleting them)

#### Viewing Recent Activities:

1. **Log In:** Start by logging in to the administration panel.
2. **Access Security Key Management:** Navigate to the "Security Key Management" section.
3. **Navigate to Users Section:** Under the "Security Key Management" section, locate and click on the "Users" section. This section lists all users associated with your workspace.
4. **Select the User:** Among the list of users, find and click on the user you want to see their activities. This will lead you to the selected user detail view.
5. **Access Recent Activities:** Once you're in your user detail view, you should see a tab labeled "Activities". Click on this tab to access a list of your recent activities related to security key registrations, logins and their deletions.
6. **View Activities Log:** Inside the "Activities" tab, you'll be presented with a list of activities associated with your security key. These activities include details about when (timestamps) you registered a new credential, when you used it for login to different Relying Parties (RPs), Name and ID of the RP and the username associated with the security key.

By following these steps, you'll be able to view a list of users’ recent activities related to their security key registrations and logins. This provides you with insight into your users’ security key usage and helps you keep track of their interactions with different Relying Parties.

Also, if you need to see more general information about user activities (such as the total number of logins per day), you can use the **dashboard** in the admin panel.

It is how you can view a list of their recent activities:  
(related to registrations of passkeys and logins with them and deleting them)  

## Viewing Recent Activities:  

1. Start by logging in to the administration panel.  
2. Go to the **Users** section on the left-side menu, click the **All Users**. This section lists all users associated with your workspace.  
3. Among the list of users, find and click on the **Full Name** or **User ID** every user you want to see their activities. This will lead you to the selected user detail view.  
4. Once you’re in your user detail view, you should see a tab labeled **Activities**. Click on this tab to access a list of your recent activities related to security key registrations, logins and their deletions.  
5. Inside the **Activities** tab, you’ll be presented with a list of activities associated with your security key. These activities include details about when (timestamps) you registered a new **passkey**, when you used it for login to different Relying Parties (RPs), Name and ID of the RP and the username associated with the security key.  

Or

1. Go to the **Security keys** section on the left-side menu, click the **Active**. This section lists all Active security keys associated with your workspace.  
2. Among the list of security keys, find and click on the Clock icon in the **Last Activity** column you want to see their activities.  
3. Inside the **Activities** tab, you’ll be presented with a list of activities associated with your security key. These activities include details about when (timestamps) you registered a new **passkey**, when you used it for login to different Relying Parties (RPs), Name and ID of the RP and the username associated with the security key.  

By following these steps, you’ll be able to view a list of users’ recent activities related to their security key registrations and logins. This provides you with insight into your users’ security key usage and helps you keep track of their interactions with different Relying Parties.  

Also, if you need to see more general information about user activities (such as the total number of logins per day), you can use the **dashboard** in the admin panel.

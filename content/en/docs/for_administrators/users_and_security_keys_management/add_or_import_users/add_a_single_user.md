Steps for adding a single user:

1. Access All Users: Click **All Users** under **Users** section of admin panel.  
2. Initiate User Addition: To add a single user, click on the New User option. This will open a wizard for adding a new user.  
3. Enter User Information: In the wizard, enter all the necessary information about the user. This might include details like name, email, username, etc. Choose the groups that you want the user to be a part of. These groups might determine the userâ€™s permissions and access rights.  
4. Security Key Assignment: If you want, you can also assign a security key of any type, i.e. smartphone, card, fingerprint, or USB key, to this user.

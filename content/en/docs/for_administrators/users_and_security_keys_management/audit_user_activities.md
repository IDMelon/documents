## Recent activities

(related to registrations of credentials and logins with them and deleting them)

#### Viewing Recent Activities:

1. **Log In:** Start by logging in to the administration panel.
2. **Access Security Key Management:** Navigate to the "Security Key Management" section.
3. **Navigate to Users Section:** Under the "Security Key Management" section, locate and click on the "Users" section. This section lists all users associated with your workspace.
4. **Select the User:** Among the list of users, find and click on the user you want to see their activities. This will lead you to the selected user detail view.
5. **Access Recent Activities:** Once you're in your user detail view, you should see a tab labeled "Activities". Click on this tab to access a list of your recent activities related to security key registrations, logins and their deletions.
6. **View Activities Log:** Inside the "Activities" tab, you'll be presented with a list of activities associated with your security key. These activities include details about when (timestamps) you registered a new credential, when you used it for login to different Relying Parties (RPs), Name and ID of the RP and the username associated with the security key.

These are the steps to disable activity logs for a user:  

1. Log in to the admin panel.  
2. Go to the **Users** section on the left-side menu, click the **All Users**. This section lists all users associated with your workspace.  
3. Among the list of users, find and click on the **Full Name** or **User ID** of the user you want to see their activities. This will lead you to the selected user detail view.  
4. Inside the user detail view, click on the tab labeled **Info** and then click on the pencil icon to initiate editing mode.  
5. Uncheck Auditable Option: While in editing mode, find the **Auditable** checkbox. Uncheck this option to indicate that you no longer want to log activities for this user.
6. After unchecking the **Auditable** option, make sure to save your changes by clicking the **Save** button.  

By following these steps, youâ€™ll successfully disable activity logs for the selected user. This means that their security key-related activities, such as registrations and logins, will no longer be logged or tracked.

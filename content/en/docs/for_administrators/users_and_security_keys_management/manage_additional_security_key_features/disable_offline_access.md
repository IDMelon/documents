3. Locate Offline Login Option: Inside the user's detail view, locate the **Action** column. In this column, you'll find an option related to enabling or disabling offline login. This option is usually represented by a switch or checkbox.
4. Access Security Keys Tab: Within your user detail view, locate and click on the tab labeled **Security Keys**.
5. Enable or Disable Offline Login: Click on the actions (three dot icon) for the security key you want to enable offline login option. Select **Enable Offline Login** option.

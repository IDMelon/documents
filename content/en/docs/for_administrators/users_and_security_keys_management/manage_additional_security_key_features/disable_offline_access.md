Here are the steps to enable or disable the offline login option for a user’ security key in their detail view:  

1. Log in to the admin panel.  
2. Go to the **Users** section on the left-side menu, click the **All Users**. This section lists all users associated with your workspace.  
3. Among the list of users, find and click on the **Full Name** or **User ID** of the user you want to see their activities. This will lead you to the selected user detail view.  
4. Inside the user’s detail view, locate the **Security keys** column. Click on the actions (three dot icon) for the security key you want to enable or disable offline login option. Select **Enable/Disable Offline Login** option.  
5. After making your selection, remember to save your changes by clicking the **Confirm** button.  

By following these steps, you can easily enable or disable the offline login option for the selected user. This feature allows the user to utilize their security key for offline logins for a limited number of times within a specified timeframe, providing flexibility and security for scenarios where internet connectivity might be temporarily unavailable.

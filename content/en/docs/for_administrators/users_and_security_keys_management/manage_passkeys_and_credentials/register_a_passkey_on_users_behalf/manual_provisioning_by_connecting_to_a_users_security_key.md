### Except Entra ID, to register credentials manually on behalf of a user on any other RP, follow the steps below:

1. Access Security Key Management: Go to the Security Key Management section.  
2. Navigate to Users: Click on the Users menu within the Security Key Management section.  
3. Select User for Manual RP Provisioning: Click on a user that you want to create credential on his behalf.  
4. Initiate RP Provisioning: From the top of the user's details page, choose "Connect to register passkeys". Now it is like the selected users’ security key is attached to your PC.  
5. Register on user’s behalf: You can now register credentials on user’s behalf anywhere you want.  
6. Completion: Once you've completed the provisioning process, disconnect the user by choosing the same button on top of user’s details page.  

Before starting the provisioning process, ensure you've completed the prerequisites such as installing the Pairing Tool Software.

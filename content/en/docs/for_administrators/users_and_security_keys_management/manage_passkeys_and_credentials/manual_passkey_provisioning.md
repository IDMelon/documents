Except Entra ID, to register credentials, including passkeys, manually on behalf of a user on any other RP, follow the steps below:  

1. Go to the **All Users** section under the **Users**.  
2. Click on a user that you want to create a credential or passkey on their behalf.  
3. From the top of the user's details page, choose **Passkeys**, and then click the **+Passkey** button on the right top corner. Choose the **Other Platforms/applications** option. Before the registration process begins, to make it as if the selected users’ security key is attached to your PC, you are required to click the **Open** button when a pop-up appears saying **The site is trying to open Pairing Tool**. Therefore, Pairing Tool becomes ready for a registration on behalf of this user.  
4. You can now register credentials including passkeys on user’s behalf anywhere you want.  
5. Once you've completed the provisioning process, open Pairing Tool, and disconnect the user by clicking the **Back to normal mode**.  

Before starting the provisioning process, ensure you've completed the prerequisites such as installing the Pairing Tool Software.

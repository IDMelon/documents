Single Sign-On (SSO) is a session-based authentication service that allows a user to use one set of login credentials, for example a username and password, to access multiple applications at once. SSO can be used by small/medium-sized enterprises and individual users to simplify the management of multiple credentials. Any web service which supports federated identity protocols like SAML, OpenID, or OATH2.0 can be set up and users can enjoy Simple Single Sign-On (SSO) to access these platforms, including Slack, Salesforce, Oracle, SAP, Workday, Cerner and many more.

Using IDmelon Simple Sign-On, you can move one step ahead of common SSO. IDmelon takes your passwordless experience to whole another level. Once SSO is enabled by organizationsâ€™ IT admins, employees do not deal with neither a password nor a username! Instead, all they do is click on the "Sign in with a Security Key" button and present their security keys to log in and access all the websites and applications at once.

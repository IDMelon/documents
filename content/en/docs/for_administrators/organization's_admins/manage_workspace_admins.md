To manage workspace admins, go to your panel settings and then click on "Admins". Here, you can see a list of admins, with the first one is the person who created the workspace. You can add a new admin by clicking "+ New Admin". When you click "+ New Admin", a form will pop up. The "Add a New Admin" process has 2 steps.  

1. First, you should add their email address. Please note that the person must be a user first and have an active security key. If you haven't added them as a user yet, please refer to the instructions on how to [add a single user](link to the instructions).  
2. After adding their email, the next step is specifying their "Additional Permission". You can adjust the new admin's permission from "User Management" to "Full Access".

The "Geographical Information" condition in security key policies allows administrators to set rules and restrictions based on the geographical location from which a user is attempting to authenticate using their security key. This condition adds an additional layer of security by controlling access based on the physical location of the user.

Here's how the "Geographical Information" condition works within security key policies:

- Geographical Information: This refers to the physical location of the user attempting to authenticate. Geographical information will be determined based on GPS coordinates of user’s smartphone.
- Access Control: With the "Geographical Information" condition, administrators can configure policies that dictate whether a user can access the system using their security key from specific geographical locations or ranges.
- Enhanced Security: By implementing policies based on the "Geographical Information" condition, organizations can enhance security by ensuring that users can only access systems or applications from approved geographical locations.
- Use Cases: For example, an organization might set a policy that allows users to authenticate using their security key only when they are within the company's physical office (around the company’s building) or within a physical boundary of a specific city (the city that the company’s office is located in). This restricts access to devices located within trusted areas.

In summary, the "Geographical Information" condition within security key policies enables organizations to define access rules and restrictions based on the physical location of the user. This approach adds an extra layer of security by ensuring that only approved geographical locations can be used for secure access, enhancing control over authentication processes.

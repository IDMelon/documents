IDmelon offers a **tap-to-login** solution that simplifies legacy secure authentication for users by leveraging FIDO2-based encryption and a card reader. In this solution, when a registered card is tapped, the system securely decrypts and fills in saved passwords. This process enhances security while providing convenience by eliminating the need to remember or manually enter passwords.
This solution can be deployed in several environments which will be explain separately.

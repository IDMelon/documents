## End-user new passwordless experience

In today's digital landscape, the security of our identities remains an ongoing concern, with organizations constantly striving to safeguard their critical data. The evolving tactics of attackers have rendered traditional defense mechanisms inadequate in securing internal systems and sensitive information. Notably, passwords have emerged as a major vulnerability, responsible for more than 80% of data breaches. In light of this, it's time to embrace a transformative approach.

Introducing the concept of passwordless authentication, which revolutionizes the way users prove their identities without relying on conventional passwords. Unlike the traditional username/password method, passwordless authentication hinges on the use of something the user possesses â€“ typically a designated device, such as a smartphone. It removes the need for cumbersome passwords, marking a significant step toward heightened security and user convenience.

Moreover, the synergy of passwordless authentication with Single Sign-On (SSO) adds a layer of efficiency. This integration empowers organizations to expand their application portfolio accessible via passwordless methods. As users gain access to an increasing array of applications, the reliance on passwords diminishes further. The passwordless experience not only fortifies cybersecurity measures but also streamlines user interaction with technology, promising a more secure and user-friendly digital environment.

## Self-Managed Deployment

Self-managed deployments cater to organizations that prefer full control over their infrastructure or have specific security and compliance requirements. These deployments are hosted in private environments or on-premises.

### Single Node

- **Self-Managed Single Node Deployment**

  - Simplified deployment on a standalone server.
  - Suitable for smaller-scale environments or non-critical applications.
  - Requires less setup effort compared to cluster deployments but lacks redundancy and scalability.
  - Minimum Requirements: OS:**Linux** or **Windows Server 2016+**, CPU: 4 cores, RAM: 8 GB, Hard Drive: 50 GB.

### Cluster

- **Self-Managed Cluster Deployment**
  
  - Designed for larger environments that need **high availability** and **load balancing**.
  - Utilizes a cluster of nodes for resilience and performance.
  - Offers greater scalability compared to single-node setups, making it ideal for mission-critical workloads.
  - Requires additional expertise to manage and maintain but ensures redundancy and fault tolerance.

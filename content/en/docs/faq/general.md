        <p class="faq-p">IDmelon provides you with passwordless authentication services for both personal and business purposes.
        With IDmelon, everyone can use their iPhone or Android smartphone, Key FOB, or Access Card as a FIDO2 security key, so that they no longer need a password to log into their
        laptop/desktop and online services/accounts such as Microsoft, Office 365, GitHub, or any other FIDO2 supported platforms.<br>
        The IDmelon FIDO Orchestration Platform helps organizations simply and quickly deploy secure passwordless authentication for their users.
        Features like Security Key as a Service, FIDO2 managed security keys, and fully automated FIDO2 lifecycle are patented and unique approaches that help organizations enhance
        their workforce authentication security overnight.
        No more dealing with purchase and distribution of hardware FIDO security keys as organizations can use whatever device their users have as a FIDO2 security key. It can be an
        Access Card, Key FOB or smartphone.</p>

            Using passwords for authentication will cause many threats to
            users.
            FIDO authentication protocol removes passwords and their related
            threats by providing users a simpler passwordless login experience. IDmelon as a pioneer, implements smartphones as a
            security key based on
            <a href="/docs/scrty/fido/" target="_blank">FIDO</a>. To ensure that this solution is more
            secure, despite the security considerations in FIDO (described <a href="/docs/scrty/fido/" target="_blank">here</a>),
            IDmelon has also considered and implemented many security controls to increase the level of confidence for its users which is described in <a href="/docs/scrty/idmelon_security/" target="_blank">IDmelon security</a> section.

            IDmelon eliminates the burden of carrying an extra physical object, i.e. a security key, around all the time which is cumbersome, unnatural and at a serious risk of being
            lost, stolen, damaged or left behind. IDmelon offers a great user experience by enabling users to use whatever they have as a FIDO security key, be it their ubiquitous
            smartphones which are rarely out of sight or a Key FOB or an Access Card for a great tap-n-login experience.<br>
            IDmelon offers Security Key as a Service which cuts the costs of hardware security key purchase, distribution, replacement, and delivery.<br>
            And most importantly, the IDmelon Admin Panel allows enterprises to monitor and control their employeesâ€™ security access etc.

## What is IDmelon ?

IDmelon is a passwordless authentication service which provides a convenient and secure way for you to log into your websites and applications.
You can use your iPhone or Android smartphone as a USB FIDO2 hardware security key, so that you no longer need a password to log into your
laptop/desktop and online services/accounts such as Microsoft, Office 365, GitHub, or any other FIDO2 supported platforms.
In fact, you can register your smartphone as a security key to the online service, authenticate your identity by using one of the preferably
local authentication mechanisms available on the smartphone such as biometrics instead of traditional username/password logins and, therefore,
keep your laptop/desktop and information safe in a convenient and secure way.
However, if you are not willing to use your smartphone or your workplace has restricted the use of smartphones, you can use an IDmelon Key for passwordless logins.

## How secure is IDmelon ?

Biometric authentication on smartphones that is becoming increasingly a common reliable and convenient way of unlocking a device cannot be extended
through modern FIDO2 standards beyond smaphones. But, IDmelon has successfully enabled smartphones to be certified FIDO2 security keys.
Besides, embedded Secure Elements protect information from becoming compromised.

## How is IDmelon different from security keys ?

IDmelon eliminates the burden of carrying an extra physical object, i.e. a security key, around all the time which is cumbersome,
unnatural and at a serious risk of being lost, stolen, damaged or left behind. Users are not forced to pair their smartphones with PCs via Bluetooth,
so don’t worry if Bluetooth on your PC isn’t working properly. In fact, IDmelon offers a great user experience by enabling a ubiquitous smartphone
which is rarely out of sight to be a FIDO2 certified security key.

IDmelon offers Security Key as a Service which cuts the costs of hardware security key purchase, distribution, replacement, and delivery.

And most importantly, the IDmelon Admin Panel allows enterprises to monitor and control their employees’ security access.

## How is IDmelon different from from other smartphone-based authentication solutions ?

In addition to management panel, IDmelon allows users to share a PC by a single tap of their smartphones on an IDmelon Reader to go login without having
to pair their smartphones with the PC via Bluetooth.

## Is there a standalone IDmelon app for smarth watches ?

No, and you cannot approve authentication requests on smartwatches via notifications.

## What is IDmelon Reader ?

It is a small BLE reader that connects to a USB port on a PC to enable a user to log into the PC, websites, and applications without a password. IDmelon Reader allows a user
to authenticate their identity by simply tapping their smartphone, Key FOB, or Access Card on the Reader in order to log in.

Everyone can use IDmelon Reader, but it is specially designed for shared PC environments in which multiple users can use a single PC without compromising security.
It is ideal for deskless workers, shift workers, and people who are constantly on the move, not anchored to a computer/desk, or work in industries such as retail, education,
manufacturing, or healthcare as well as workplaces where mobile phones are restricted.

USB port on the PC to enable to go passwordless after a single tap on the Reader.

Yes. IDmelon Reader allows an unlimited number of users to use their security keys to log into windows, websites, and apps on the same PC in a convenient and secure way.

## How many user can use the same IDmelon Reader ?

With IDmelon, you don’t need to carry an extra physical object, i.e. a security key, around all the time. And in addition to unlimited storage capacity for credentials,
credentials can be both managed and audited.

It also helps enterprises reduce deployment time and costs significantly, since there no longer exist the need for HR for security key purchase, distribution, replacement,
and delivery.

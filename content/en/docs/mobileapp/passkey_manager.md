### Passkey Manager

IDmelon application allows users to store their passkeys safely instead of using old passwords. But this feature was
limited to use for computers until today. Simultaneously with the release of Android 14, Google has provided a feature
that allows Android applications to use passkey to authenticate their users.

#### How to use:

1.	Ensure your device is running Android 14 or higher.
2.	Install IDmelon app from [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vancosys.authenticator.business).
3.	Open IDmelon app.
4.	Activate a security key (refer to [this link](https://docs.idmelon.com/docs/for_users/activate_work_account/) for how to activate a security key).
5.	Go to smartphone Settings -> Passwords & accounts and enable IDmelon as passkey manager (just turn the switch button on).
6.	Now you can open and use third-party apps which support register/login with passkey.
7.	When you sign up or register, credential will be added to the account section of IDmelon.
8.	Then you can sign in easily and with high security.

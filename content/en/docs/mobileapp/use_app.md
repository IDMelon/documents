IDmelon Mobile App works in combination with either IDmelon Client App or an IDmelon Reader and enables users to use their smartphones as a security key.
See the instructions below:

- First, download and install IDmelon app from App Store or Google Play.

- Then, go with one of the options below:

<ol>
<li>Plug an IDmelon Reader to a USB port of the PC and start experiencing Tap & Go!</li>
<li>Scan a QR code from IDmelon Client app on the PC screen once on the first try to pair your smartphone with the PC and start experiencing Push Authentication!</li>
</ol>

After users complete the setup, they will be able to access Microsoft, Office 365, GitHub, and many more FIDO2 supported platforms and simply and securely log into Windows, websites, and applications without having to type a password.

There are two ways to get started with IDmelon Mobile App:

All IDmelon personal users have an individual panel at IDmelon which they can access through [this link](https://login.idmelon.com/?sp=panel.idmelon.com&idp_init=False&req=18353303-1f5d-4f38-9197-2eb0bd54edb6).

## Create Personal Account

---

If users already have an IDmelon account on their smartphone, they can log in to their panel by opening [this link](https://login.idmelon.com/?sp=panel.idmelon.com&idp_init=False&req=18353303-1f5d-4f38-9197-2eb0bd54edb6) and clicking on **Sign in with a security key** tapping on their IDmelon Mobile App Security Key.\
To create a personal account users have two ways, the first way is through **a smartphone**, and the second way is through **IDmelon Website**.

- To create an IDmelon account by **a smartphone**, please visit the [Mobile App Guide](/docs/mobileapp/use_app/#psersonal-users) page.

- To create an IDmelon account on **IDmelon Website**, please read the following instructions.

1. First open [IDmelon Panel's Login](https://login.idmelon.com/?sp=panel.idmelon.com&idp_init=False&req=18353303-1f5d-4f38-9197-2eb0bd54edb6) page and click on **Create one!**

4. If you like to sync your panel with your smartphone, scan the QR code that is shown on your browser. This will add your account to **IDmelon Mobile App** on your smartphone. Remember that you have to approve adding this account to your mobile app by tapping on **Approve**. After that click on **Next**.

    It is also possible to skip this step.

## User Options

---

When you log in to your IDmelon panel, you can see your username on the top right of the panel alongside a blue box and
a small arrow pointing down. If you click on the box or arrow or your username, a Dropdown menu will be opened with 3
options. The first option is **Security**, the second is **Profile Info**, and the third is **Logout**.

### Security

This page shows all the security keys that a user has connected to his/her account.

> **Note:** Before trying to add a security key device to your account, install IDmelon Pairing Tool on your computer and pair your smartphone with it or have a Reader ready to use.
To download **Pairing Tool** visit [this link](https://idmelon.com/docs/downloads).
To ready your **Reader** visit [this link](https://www.idmelon.com/idmelon-reader).

1. By clicking on **Add Security Key**, a user can add a new security key to his/her account. After clicking on **Add Security Key**, a wizard will open and ask about how a user wants to create a new security key. Here we recommend choosing **External Security Key or built-in sensor**, because this document is for personal users and most personal users do not have other devices such as **Reader** or **Contactless Card**, and this option enables the user to use their smartphone as a security key.
2. There will be two wizards shown by the user's operating system that ask the user for **Security Key Setup** permission. Users have to give this permission.
3. If the user's smartphone is already paired with **Pairing Tool**, then IDmelon application will pop up a screen which looks like the screen below, tap on the security key that you want to register your account on.

4. Tap on **Approve**.

5. On this step, the smartphone's **GPS** and **Bluetooth** must be turned on, as well as the  **Bluetooth** of the user's computer. This helps the IDmelon application to prove that the user who is using a certain phone is close to the computer that he or she is using and thus adds the device to the user's account.

6. If everything is done as explained, the user's smartphone will be added to the account.

The admin may want to register security key on behalf of a user in some circumstances. To do this, the admin can use the OBR procedure which can be done starting from pairing tool by doing the following steps: 

**Prerequisite for OBR**:
- User must install IDmelon Authenticator app on his smartphone. 

- User security key status must be active in administration panel (Admin must add the user to the panel via invitation email and user must accept the invitation)  

**OBR steps**:
1. Admin opens Pairing Tool, presses Cntl+I to choose Login as an Admin.

5.	Now, admin can log into the user's Microsoft account, for example, by entering the user's username and password to add/register IDmelon security key on behalf of the user. 

6.	The user will immediately receive a notification on his smartphone and understands that their admin is doing an OBR.

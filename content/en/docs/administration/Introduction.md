To secure access to sensitive data, enterprises must be able to manage users who log in to security key-protected online accounts and applications as their employees come and go. Plus, the rise of privacy concerns increases the need for enterprises to authenticate the identity of online employees and asset. While there is no control or management over hardware security keys by organizations, one strong point that makes IDmelon stand out versus other FIDO2 vendors on the market is the ability to manage security keys within organizations. This ability reduces friction in implementing passwordless authentication in companies, systems, and also for individuals.

IDmelon orchestration platform enables enterprises to:

- use smartphones or contactless cards (with any form factor such as HID access card, proximity, and RFID tags/badges) as a managed security key;

- frictionless authentication through Simple Sign-On for Single Sign-On (SSO for SSO);

- drive down operational costs and reduce project implementation time;

- manage and monitor security keys;

- create security key policies to restrict users’ access to meet organization’s security needs.

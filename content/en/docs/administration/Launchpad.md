This page guides administrators through three main stages of the deployment journey on IDmelon Orchestration Platform. In other words, the Launchpad is intended to help administrators get started faster with basic tasks in the panel. The first part of this section (**Import users**) can be used to add users one by one or in bulk by importing from a CSV File or Azure AD. The second part (**Assign keys to users**) can be used to assign security keys to users. Finally, the last part (**Create security key policies**) helps admins create new policies according to their organizationâ€™s security needs.

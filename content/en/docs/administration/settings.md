## Admins

The first admin who has created the workspace can add as many admins as necessary to manage the users in the workspace by selecting **New Admin** button in
**Admins** section under **Settings**. Different levels of permissions to manage users and security keys can be given to new admins. Note that users should
be already activated before becoming an admin.

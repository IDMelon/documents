Please note that you need to enter your business email to represent your organization; you cannot use an email at a free domain.
We know that it might be tempting to skip the End User License Agreement and Privacy Policy, but it is important to read them and have a mutual understanding of what we expect from each other.
To verify your email address, you will receive a verification code via email:

</p>

Then, you should choose a way you would like to log into your panel;

<p align="center">

you can either add a security key now or later:

</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="/images/vendor/Panel/touch2.png" class="doc-img-frame">
</p>

or you will receive a versification code via email or SMS for each login:

</p>

To create a Business Workspace, you are required to provide some information. While you don’t have to enter your phone number, you need to provide your company URL and name:

<p align="center">

</p>

The information you provide can be later found in the Workspace section of Settings entry on the Navigation Menu on the left side of the panel:

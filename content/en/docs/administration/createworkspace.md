## Access the IDmelon Admin Panel

To access the IDmelon Admin Panel, navigate to the IDmelon Admin Panel [Here](https://panel.idmelon.com).
Present your security key to experience a frictionless login, or create a workspace on behalf of your organization if it is your first try.

## Create Workspace

If it is the first time that you are here to create a new workspace on behalf of your organization, click the “Create one!” to see the page below:

Please note that you need to enter your business email to represent your organization; you cannot use an email at a free domain.
We know that it might be tempting to skip the End User License Agreement and Privacy Policy, but it is important to read them and have a mutual understanding of what we expect from each other.
To verify your email address, you will receive a verification code via email:

Then, you should choose a way you would like to log into your panel;

or you will receive a versification code via email or SMS for each login:

To create a Business Workspace, you are required to provide some information. While you don’t have to enter your phone number, you need to provide your company URL and name:

The information you provide can be later found in the Workspace section of Settings entry on the Navigation Menu on the left side of the panel:

Here, on the same page, you can also enable Proximity or add a Trusted Domain.

 In this page, administrators can request as many licenses as they want. Licenses are required so that users can activate their security keys, specially for a user whom the
 main administrator wants to promote to administrator.

* Navigate to **Licenses** tab in administration panel and click on **Request for New Licenses**. After that, a small window will pop up.

* As you can see, you just have to write down the number of licenses that you want, and click on **Send Request**.

* As you can see your requestâ€™s status remains pending until the master administrator accepts your request. After that, you can go to Users tab to choose the users whom you
want to grant license to.

FIDO2 certified mobile-based authentication solution from IDmelon helps organizations to equip their users with FIDO-enabled phishing resistant security keys through the devices in their hand. IDmelon is engineered to provide a simple, secure and streamlined login experience for every user as a standard solution, with no additional work needed.
IDmelon authentication solution starts by IDmelon Authenticator and enables smartphones to be used as a FIDO2 security key where credentials are stored securely and user verification is done through smartphone built-in biometrics sensors.
This reduces the cost of biometrics security keys and increases the ease of use and friction-free experience for end users. However, The IDmelon offers other authentication services which is totally available in three different ways:

- With an IDmelon Reader in stand-alone mode as a FIDO2 USB security key
- In Reader mode as a smartphone BLE reader
- With IDmelon Pairing Tool app using only smartphone directly as the security key

The description of the first two cases is given in the I have an IDmelon Reader section and details about the third case is also available in the I want to use Pairing Tool section. Also, in each of the described cases the IDmelon Admin Panel can be used to manage related data.

## What do we provide for individuals?

As passwords have touched every aspect of daily life, today access to almost everything depends on a password. Some individuals seek passwordless authentication for their personal use. They go for passwordless because they are interested in the experience, concerned about security, or annoyed by password fatigue.
Security keys can enable them to protect their data from unauthorized access without having to deal with passwords anymore. But, IDmelon believes that hardware security keys are not the answer, which simply replaces one problem with another. Why do users have to carry an extra physical object around? Why do they have to pay for something they already have?
With IDmelon, it only takes a few clicks to simply and securely turn smartphones into a FIDO2 security key without the need for any extra physical object. Fast, secure, and convenient.

## What do we provide for enterprises?

### Management Panel

To secure access to sensitive data, enterprises must be able to manage users who log in to securitykey-protected online accounts and applications, as their employees come and go. Plus, the rise of privacy concerns increases the need for enterprises to authenticate the identity of online employees and asset.
While there is no control or management over hardware security keys by organisations, one strong point that makes IDmelon stand out versus other FIDO2 vendors on the market is the ability to manage security keys within organisations. This ability reduces friction in implementing passwordless authentication in companies, systems, and also for individuals.
IDmelon Admin Panel enables enterprises to:

- Drive down operational costs and reduce project implementation times;
- Manage and monitor security keys;
- Reduce the need for human resources to implement and run the system.

### Shared PC Environments

The majority of the worldâ€™s employees including deskless workers, who are not anchored to a desk/computer, and shift workers, who too use a shared PC, have to log out of the system/app at the end of each session so that another user can login to the same computer or software.
Constant key unplugging and re-plugging can be cumbersome or easily distract them from work. The pressures of not forgetting a key, leaving it behind, losing, or damaging it can cause a reduction in productivity. And continuous complaints from employers prove that recurring costs of purchase, distribution, delivery, and replacement in case of security loss or damage is unavoidable.
IDmelon has proudly implemented a unique tap-n-go experience for the first time in the world on the FIDO2 standards that allows an unlimited number of users to use their smartphones as an external security key for login to windows, websites and apps on the same computer via a very comfortable and secure way.
Here, to use your smartphone as a security key, you do not even need to open the app. All you need to do is to tap your smartphone on an IDmelon Reader and then say yes to the login request notification on the smartphone and authenticate your identity.

## Get started

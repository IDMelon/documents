IDmelon Mobile App works in combination with either IDmelon Pairing Tool or an IDmelon Reader and enables users to use their smartphones as a security key.

**Instructions:**

1. First, download and install IDmelon Authenticator from App Store or Google Play.

2. Then, go with one of the options below:

   - Plug an IDmelon Reader to a USB port of the PC and start experiencing Tap & Go!

   - Scan a QR code from IDmelon Pairing Tool on the PC screen once on the first try to pair your smartphone with the PC and start experiencing Push Authentication!

After users complete the setup, they will be able to access Microsoft, Office 365, GitHub, and many more FIDO2 supported platforms and simply and securely log into Windows, websites, and applications without having to type a password.

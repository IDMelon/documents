All IDmelon personal users have an individual panel at IDmelon which they can access
through [this link](https://login.idmelon.com/?sp=panel.idmelon.com&idp_init=False&req=18353303-1f5d-4f38-9197-2eb0bd54edb6).

## Create Personal Account

---

If users already have an IDmelon account on their smartphone, they can log in to their panel by
opening [this link](https://login.idmelon.com/?sp=panel.idmelon.com&idp_init=False&req=18353303-1f5d-4f38-9197-2eb0bd54edb6)
and clicking on **Sign in with a security key**, tapping on their IDmelon Mobile App Security Key. To create a personal
account, users have two ways: the first way is through **a smartphone**, and the second way is through
**IDmelon Website**.

To create an IDmelon account by **a smartphone**, please visit
the [Mobile App Guide](/docs/mobileapp/use_app/#psersonal-users) page.

To create an IDmelon account on **IDmelon Website**, please read the following instructions.

1. First
   open [IDmelon Panel's Login](https://login.idmelon.com/?sp=panel.idmelon.com&idp_init=False&req=18353303-1f5d-4f38-9197-2eb0bd54edb6)
   page and click on **Create one!**

4. If you like to sync your panel with your smartphone, scan the QR code that is shown on your browser. This will add
   your account to **IDmelon Mobile App** on your smartphone. Remember that you have to approve adding this account to
   your mobile app by tapping on **Approve**. After that click on **Next**. It is also possible to skip this step.

5. Pay attention to this page, as it informs you on how to use login using your smartphone security key. You should
   either download **IDmelon Pairing Tool** or have an **IDmelon Reader** to log in to your panel using your smartphone
   as your security key. Click **Login** to move to the login page and log in with your smartphone.
   \

## User Options

---

When you log in to your IDmelon panel, you can see your username on the top right of the panel alongside a blue box and
a small arrow pointing down. If you click on the box or arrow or your username, a Dropdown menu will be opened with 3
options. The first option is **Security**, the second is **Profile Info**, and the third is **Logout**.

### Security

This page shows all the security keys that a user has connected to his/her account.

**Note:** Before trying to add a security key device to your account, install IDmelon Pairing Tool on your computer and
pair your smartphone with it or have a Reader ready to use.
To download **Pairing Tool** visit [this link](https://www.idmelon.com/downloads/).
To ready your **Reader** visit [this link](https://www.idmelon.com/idmelon-reader/).

1. By clicking on **Add Security Key**, a user can add a new security key to his/her account. After clicking on **Add
   Security Key**, a wizard will open and ask about how a user wants to create a new security key. Here we recommend
   choosing **External Security Key or built-in sensor**, because this document is for personal users and most personal
   users do not have other devices such as **Reader** or **Contactless Card**, and this option enables the user to use
   their smartphone as a security key.

2. There will be two wizards shown by the user's operating system that ask the user for **Security Key Setup**
   permission. Users have to give this permission.

3. If the user's smartphone is already paired with **Pairing Tool**, then IDmelon application will pop up a screen which
   looks like the screen below, tap on the security key that you want to register your account on.

4. Tap on **Approve**.

5. On this step, the smartphone's **GPS** and **Bluetooth** must be turned on, as well as the **Bluetooth** of the
   user's computer. This helps the IDmelon application to prove that the user who is using a certain phone is close to
   the computer that he or she is using and thus adds the device to the user's account.

6. If everything is done as explained, the user's smartphone will be added to the account.

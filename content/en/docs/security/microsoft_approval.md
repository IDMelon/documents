With the use of public key cryptography techniques, FIDO2 security keys can replace weak credentials with strong credentials.

IDmelon has joined MISA (Microsoft Intelligent Security Association), which allows them to work closely with the Microsoft Teams and the leading security service providers working with Microsoft to enhance the security of their mutual customers. The MISA also promoted IDmelon FIDO2 smartphone-based passwordless authentication product, which is compatible with Windows and Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

IDmelon in collaboration with Microsoft enables users to effortlessly use what they already have, i.e. their ubiquitous smartphones, as a USB security key to login to Windows, cloud services such as Microsoft or any FIDO2 supported platforms on their PCs without typing a password. So, users simply and securely use biometric authentication on their smartphones to authenticate their identities and go passwordless, and therefore, concentrate on what they do instead of carrying the burden of an extra physical object, i.e., a security key.

Azure AD helps IDmelon deliver passwordless solutions that are convenient, highly secure, and time-saving. Protecting everyone on the journey to the passwordless world is inherent in IDmelon’s vision and mission: to secure the world for everyone any time anywhere!
